    <h2>🌱 Farming Practices</h2>
    <p>
        Our cabbage farming begins with carefully selected hybrid varieties suitable for consistent head formation,
        excellent shelf life, and strong disease resistance. We use a raised-bed planting method to improve drainage,
        aeration, and nutrient delivery.
    </p>

    <h2>🌿 Soil Preparation</h2>
    <p>
        We use soil enriched with organic matter, compost, and balanced fertilizer mixes. The soil is tilled to optimize
        root penetration and moisture retention, ensuring strong vegetative growth throughout the growing cycle.
    </p>

    <h2>💧 Irrigation System</h2>
    <p>
        Cabbages are irrigated using a combination of drip irrigation and overhead systems. This ensures:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Consistent moisture levels</li>
        <li>Reduced water waste</li>
        <li>Improved nutrient uptake</li>
        <li>Better head formation and weight</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>🛡️ Pest & Disease Management</h2>
    <p>
        We apply integrated pest-management (IPM) techniques, including crop rotation, biological controls,
        and safe agrochemical applications when necessary.
    </p>

    <h2>🥬 Harvest & Post-Harvest Handling</h2>
    <p>
        Cabbages are harvested manually at optimal maturity. After harvest:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Heads are trimmed and sorted by size</li>
        <li>Washed and packed immediately</li>
        <li>Kept in cool environments to maintain crispness</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>📦 Packaging & Distribution</h2>
    <p>
        We supply cabbages to wholesalers, retailers, and local markets. Orders are packed in breathable crates or bags
        to ensure freshness during transport.
